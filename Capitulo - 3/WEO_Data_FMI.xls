Revenue and expenditures of federal public enterprises are added in full to the respective aggregates. Transfers or withdrawals from the SWF do not impact the primary balance.

Prior to 2003, Total Revenue of the GG excludes interest receipts, while Total Expenditure of the GG includes net interest payments. In 2015, interest income is negative to account for Central Bank losses with swap operations. Fiscal assumptions: Fiscal projections for 2020 take into account the deficit target proposed in the budget guidance law and reflect policy announcements as of March 31. Those for the medium term assume compliance with the constitutional spending ceiling. Start/end months of reporting year: January/December GFS Manual used: Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2001.

Ministry of Finance (data retrieved from CEIC) and National Audit Office (NAO) (data obtained from NAO audit report) Latest actual data: 2019. Headline data (e.g., revenue and expenditure) is updated to 2018 number, but actual data of some detailed components (e.g. interest payment) is not available for 2018. Notes: Fiscal Balance: Data differ from official figures released by China?s Ministry of Finance mainly because of a difference in treatment of net contributions to the other accounts (e.g. Budget Stabilization Fund). General Government Debt: Data differ from official figures released by China?s Ministry of Finance because IMF numbers include, from 2010 onward, the stock of local government debt outstanding as reported in the June 2011 National Audit Office Report. For subsequent years, we have followed the amortization schedule outlined in the same report. Fiscal assumptions: Fiscal expansion is estimated for 2019 and projected for 2020, due to a series of tax reforms and expenditure measures in response to the economic slowdown.

Ecuador	General government net lending/borrowing	Percent of GDP		Source: Source: Central Bank and Ministry of Finance Latest actual data: 2019 Notes: The data for Ecuador reflect net lending/borrowing for the Non-Financial Public Sector (NFPS). Ecuadorian authorities, in the context of the EFF approved in March of 2019 and with the technical support from the IMF Staff, are undertaking revisions of the historical fiscal data for the net-lending borrowing of the NFSP with the view of correcting recently-identified statistical errors, mostly in the recording of revenues and expenditures of the local governments. Fiscal data reported in the table for 2018 and 2019 reflect the corrected series while the data for earlier years are still under revisions and will be corrected in the subsequent WEO releases as the authorities proceed with the corrections in the earlier years, going as far back as 2012. The authorities are also working on reconciling historical revenue and expenditure data with financing. Fiscal assumptions: All the fiscal series are based on 1986 methodology. The authorities have adopted a non-standard accounting methodology for budgetary purposes. Staff does not use this methodology.

United States	General government net lending/borrowing	Percent of GDP		Source: BEA and IMF's Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (revenue, expenditure, and net lending); Flow of Funds (debt) Latest actual data: 2018. Repatriation tax on foreign earnings (a provision of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), estimated at $250 billion, which accrued at end-2017 and recorded as capital transfer to the government in the GFS, was removed from government revenue. Staff's baseline projection embeds the impact of this tax provision over time to reflect the fact that corporations have eight years to pay off this tax liability. Notes: Revenue, expenditure, and net lending data are is compiled using SNA 2008, and when translated into GFS this is in accordance with GFSM 2014. Due to data limitations, most series begin 2001. Fiscal assumptions: Fiscal projections are based on the January 2020 Congressional Budget Office baseline adjusted for the IMF staff?s policy and macroeconomic assumptions. Projections then incorporate the effects of the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (all signed in March 2020). Finally, fiscal projections are adjusted to reflect the IMF staff?s forecasts for key macroeconomic and financial variables and different accounting treatment of financial sector support and of defined-benefit pension plans and are converted to a general government basis. Data is compiled using SNA 2008, and when translated into GFS this is in accordance with GFSM 2014. Due to data limitations, most series begin 2001.
